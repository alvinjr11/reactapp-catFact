note
reactlifecycle:
their are 3 phases in react life cycle
1.mounting =>component appears
2.updating =>component updates
3.unmounting =>component disappears
useEffect()is used to controll what happens depending on each stage of the component lifecycle
we can create some actions that can be triggered when the component is mounting,updating,unmounting
